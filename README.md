Tools to help run automated trading of electricity from a Sigenergy home battery system, using TypQxQ's integration for Sig + Home Assistant + modbus 
These tools are for customers of Amber Electric in Australia.

The trader.yaml file contains all the helpers needed to configure how you want to buy/sell electricity with Amber.

trader.yaml should be installed in a packages directory in your HA system.
Edit configuration.yaml and add (if not already there) an instruction to read packages from a specific directory.

```
# Use packages in /packages folder
homeassistant:
  packages: !include_dir_named packages
```

You need to create the directory called packages at the same level as configuration.yaml

Inside the "packages" directory, create a new file names "trader.yaml", edit it and paste in the contents of "trader.yaml".
If you have scp configured you can copy the file into place instead. (I find I need "scp -O" to send to my HA system).

It might be worth restarting HA to see if anything has broken so far, if all's well continue.

Next create a new dashboard view, edit the raw yaml and paste in the contents of the file config_dashboard.yaml
Save the new dashboard.

You should then have something that looks similar to this
